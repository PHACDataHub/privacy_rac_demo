Useful for finding out whether a use of information is permitted under the Privacy Act.

Requires you to know the ontology first.

The "type" of each fact should be the string "true", and the "from_ontology" value should be set to boolean false.

Pieces of information, individuals, government institutions and purposes must be defined in category facts before they are used in attribute and relationship facts.

All text values should be strings that start with lowercase letters and do not contain spaces.

The facts must exclusively use the category, attribute, and relationship predicates set out in the ontology.
Values should not be provided for boolean attributes.

If an entity is described as a government entity, include it in both the "entity" and "government_institution"
categories.

If there is an information, also specify in the facts that it is recorded.

Do not use the "identifiably_about" attribute, or "permitted_user_purpose" relationship, as these should be
derived from other facts.
